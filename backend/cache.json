      "Design\nOne of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand.

      "The camera quality is excellent — especially for photos in low light — and the battery life easily lasts me a full day. Performance is smooth and fast, nice sound quality, bought for a better price",
      "I recently purchased the iPhone 15 in Pink from Amazon, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision! From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and soft pastel pink color caught my attention—it looks even better in person than in pictures. Phone is lightweight aluminum and glass build, making the phone feel premium yet comfortable to hold. The pink shade is elegant and subtle, perfect for anyone who loves a touch of sophistication. The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is bright, sharp, and offers vibrant colors. Whether watching videos or scrolling through social media, the experience is smooth and immersive. The 48MP main camera and 12MP ultra-wide lens take incredible photos, even in low light. The details, sharpness, and colors are truly impressive. Portrait mode works beautifully, capturing professional-looking shots effortlessly. The front camera is equally good for selfies and FaceTime. Charging with the USB-C port is much more convenient than before, and fast charging is a plus. The delivery was fast and secure, with the iPhone arriving in perfect condition. The packaging was intact, and setting up the phone was a breeze. If you're looking for a stylish, powerful, and reliable phone, the iPhone 15 in Pink is a fantastic choice.",
      "The iPhone 15 is a noticeable step up from previous models. The design feels premium, and the new green color is subtle yet refreshing. Performance is smooth — apps launch instantly, and multitasking is seamless. The camera system is excellent, especially in low light, and photos come out crisp and vibrant. Battery life easily lasts a full day, even with heavy use. The display is bright and clear, perfect for watching videos or browsing. If you're upgrading from an older iPhone, the iPhone 15 feels like a worthy investment. It’s reliable, fast, and beautifully designed.",
      "It is the best phone out there in the market and runs smoothly. Worth every penny and is very strong.",
      "Very nice device I would say its a good decision. Not because its apple but the build quality, camera quality and other things they offer. It makes it very reliable and good product.",
      "Good one Iphone",
      "Goood phone for the price if u into apple . Great cameras it’s nice to have a proper 2x zoom on normal variant and not loosing much quality and it also nice to have usb c and it charge okey speed . But whenever I play games it heats up (not soo hot but hot enough to know) fast that’s the only issue I faced using this phone"

      "About the phone\nApple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.\n\nWhy it is better than Android?\nYou pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.\n\nApple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14\nThe reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find \"the very few changes\" interesting in 14, go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)\n14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)\n\nConcern you must have.\nApple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.\n\nApple care.\nI am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.\nRead more",

      "The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing. Overall I think this is a great phone to purchase if you are looking for a durable and sustainable upgrade and I do think it is worth the extra hundred dollars from the 13.",
      "Achcha hai",
      "Why did you pick this product vs others?:\nIt was awesome",
      "This is 2nd time the display went off by itself , these iPhone are costly but with no reliability, please stop buying and tech Apple a lesson.",

      "I snagged the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival for an unbeatable price of 45,000, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in every way!\n\nScreen: The display is absolutely stunning – crisp, vibrant, and the colors pop like never before. Watching videos or scrolling through photos is a treat for the eyes. No complaints here!\n\nHanging: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. This phone handles multitasking like a champ. Switching between apps is smooth, and I haven't experienced any frustrating delays.\n\nBattery: The battery life is surprisingly impressive. I can go a full day with normal usage, and it still has juice left in the tank. No more anxiously searching for a charger midday – a definite win!\n\nComfort: The sleek design makes it a pleasure to hold, and the phone is just the right weight. It feels premium and comfortable in my hand, making it a joy to use for extended periods.\n\nImage Quality: The camera on the iPhone 13 is a true standout. The photos are sharp, and the night mode is a game-changer for capturing memories in low light.

      "We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.\n\nOnce again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.\n\nThe regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.\n\nThe overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo’s beard as he stared up into the sun.\n\nDISPLAY\n1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive\n2. Slightly different button placement\n3. Pink and blue are standout colors\n4. New Green color launched March 2022\n\nCAMERA\n1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung\n2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode\n3. Photographic styles give you creative control\n\nVIDEO\n1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh\n2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video quality\n\nPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic\n1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again\n2. Machine learning performance notably better\n\nBATTERY LIFE\n1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12\n\nSoftware\n1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends\n2. Focus cuts down on distractions\n\nVERDICT :\nThe iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12’s endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn’t recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.\n\nI don’t think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic’s muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.\n\nI’m also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I’d like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around — be it via USB-C or MagSafe — as well as a 120Hz display.\n\nThe bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.\nRead more",

      "I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.\n\nThe design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”\n\nThe display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.\n\nIf you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!"

      "Excellent screen clarity. Smooth in hands. Total glass coating. Beautiful design. Fast charging. Nice camera performance. Really good phone. I don't play games.",
      "It does look promising as being one of the new generations of phones. Eye catching camera panel and classy design. Battery life is good with optimized usage of gaming. Qualcomm SM6375 Snapdragon 695 5G (6 nm): Octa-core (2x2.2 GHz Kryo 660 Gold & 6x1.7 GHz Kryo 660 Silver); Adreno 619 with Liquid Technology provides less latency. However some of theme features are not too great which one can modify by themselves. Speaker Output is not too great despite of being dual speaker phone, so not sure if Dolby Atmos is actually working. Video is capped at 1080...but I think its still AI...so 4K is not much required as off now in INDIA. Android 12 is expected with future updates. Its a worth buying mid range budget friendly phone following almost the same legacy of flagship phone POCO F1.",

      "The camera quality is excellent — especially for photos in low light — and the battery life easily lasts me a full day. Performance is smooth and fast, nice sound quality, bought for a better price",
      "I recently purchased the iPhone 15 in Pink from Amazon, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision! From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and soft pastel pink color caught my attention—it looks even better in person than in pictures. Phone is lightweight aluminum and glass build, making the phone feel premium yet comfortable to hold. The pink shade is elegant and subtle, perfect for anyone who loves a touch of sophistication. The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is bright, sharp, and offers vibrant colors. Whether watching videos or scrolling through social media, the experience is smooth and immersive. The 48MP main camera and 12MP ultra-wide lens take incredible photos, even in low light. The details, sharpness, and colors are truly impressive. Portrait mode works beautifully, capturing professional-looking shots effortlessly. The front camera is equally good for selfies and FaceTime. Charging with the USB-C port is much more convenient than before, and fast charging is a plus. The delivery was fast and secure, with the iPhone arriving in perfect condition. The packaging was intact, and setting up the phone was a breeze. If you're looking for a stylish, powerful, and reliable phone, the iPhone 15 in Pink is a fantastic choice.",
      "The iPhone 15 is a noticeable step up from previous models. The design feels premium, and the new green color is subtle yet refreshing. Performance is smooth — apps launch instantly, and multitasking is seamless. The camera system is excellent, especially in low light, and photos come out crisp and vibrant. Battery life easily lasts a full day, even with heavy use. The display is bright and clear, perfect for watching videos or browsing. If you're upgrading from an older iPhone, the iPhone 15 feels like a worthy investment. It’s reliable, fast, and beautifully designed.",
      "It is the best phone out there in the market and runs smoothly. Worth every penny and is very strong.",
      "Good one Iphone",
      "Zhakkas item, worth it 🫶\n\nThanks Amazon",
      "Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use\n\nPros\n- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants\n- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here\n- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless\n- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA\n- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome\n- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.\n- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone\n- Apples approach on Security!\n- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless\n\nCons\n- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm\n- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases\n\nIndustry memes\n- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much\n- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!\n- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?\n- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting\n\nTips of managing battery health\n- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh\n- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up\n- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging\n- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%\n- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service\n- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section\n- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc\n- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above\n\nVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.\n\n….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience\nRead more",
